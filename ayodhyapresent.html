        <h2>AYODHYA'S RAM MANDIR.</h2>
         
<div>
<p class="ijk">The new Ram temple under construction in Ayodhya, ahead of its inauguration on January 22, 2024.
    Ram Mandir, Ayodhya, a grand Hindu temple inaugurated on January 22, 2024, at a site in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India, believed to be the birthplace of the Hindu deity Ram. The site is where the Babri Masjid, a Mughal-era mosque, stood until December 6, 1992, when Hindu activists destroyed the mosque and tensions between religious groups led to rioting throughout the country.</p>
    
    <p class="ijk">The site at which the under-construction Ram Mandir stands has long been an area of conflict. The Hindu community considers it Ram Janmabhoomi, or Ram’s birthplace, while the Muslim community holds it sacred as the spot where the 16th-century Babri Masjid stood, and numerous lawsuits were filed by both communities for possession of the site. A court ruling in 2010 divided the land between Hindus and Muslims, but that decision was overturned in 2019 by the Supreme Court of India, which entrusted the site exclusively to Hindus and directed the state to grant an alternate site in Ayodhya to the Muslim community.</p>

    <h3>Consecration Ceremony & Temple Inauguration</h3>
    <p><img class="lmn" src="https://www.indiablooms.com/postcard_pic/2023/a9a1007f4caa84e6774ed7ffac9fb4fe.JPG" height="400px" width="400px"></p>
    <p class="ijk">The temple’s consecration ceremony, or prana pratishtha (establishment of life force), held on January 22, 2024, was attended by about 7,000 guests, including Bollywood celebrities, prominent athletes, business moguls, and spiritual leaders, among others. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided at the ceremony. With Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers going door-to-door in Delhi to invite residents to the temple after the consecration ceremony, theaters such as PVR INOX hosting live streams for viewers, TV channels broadcasting the consecration ceremony live, and airlines offering special flights between Delhi and Ayodhya on the inauguration day, this was a widely publicized and intensively marketed event. The day after the temple’s inauguration, roughly 300,000 devotees thronged the temple for darshan (divine vision) of the newly installed murti (devotional image) of the deity. An equal number of people were said to have been waiting outside for a turn to see the image.

<p class="ijk">India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed Monday's consecration ceremony as "the beginning of a new time cycle" in a speech to thousands of guests outside temple's complex.

    "Today our Lord Ram has come. After centuries of waiting, our Ram has arrived," Modi said. "Our Ram idol will not stay in a tent anymore. Our Ram idol will stay in a divine temple now."
    He added: "The sun of 22 January, has brought with it a wonderful aura. 22 January 2024 is not just a date on a calendar but a beginning of a new time cycle."
    "Even a thousand years later, people will be discussing this date and time," Modi said in his speech.
    Minutes before his speech, Modi broke an 11-day religious fast that he had undertaken to prepare for the festivities. He unveiled a statue of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered deities, in a consecration ceremony watched by millions.
    
    Modi did not directly mention the Babri Masjid in his speech, nor the country's Muslims, many of whom feel pain and sadness at the events that have unfolded in Ayodhya.</p>
    <p class="ijk"></p><ul type="square" class="ijk"><li>The state of Uttar Pradesh, where Ayodhya is located, has declared Monday a public holiday.</li>

       <li> All schools in the country's largest state are shut and liquor shops will be closed, according to a circular issued by Uttar Pradesh's government.</li>
        
      <li> Public schools in the national capital Delhi are shut and government office workers have been given a half day.</li>
        
       <li> Other states, including Assam in the northeast, have announced similar measures, including banning the sale of alcohol and limiting the sale of non-vegetarian food.</li>
        
        <li>Maharashtra in the west, home to financial capital Mumbai, has also declared Monday a public holiday.</li>

    <h3>New Ram temple</h3>
    <p><img class="k" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c0/34/d2/c034d2f3d9d39a076bdab9469040d7a8.jpg" height="350px" width="300px" ></p>
    <p class="ijk">Ayodhya was in the headlines again in October 2023, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the inauguration of a new, grand Ram temple (Ram Mandir) was just a few months away. Modi presided over the consecration (prana pratishtha) ceremony on January 22, 2024. Extensive arrangements were made for the inauguration, including the dispatch of invitations to thousands of spiritual leaders, saints, and eminent personalities from different fields. The planned inauguration and the invitations drew mixed reactions from various people and political parties. The Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal announced that he would visit the temple with his family after the consecration day. Senior Congress Party leaders, such as Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, turned down the invitation to the consecration ceremony. Some of them visited the temple before the inauguration day, saying they did not need an invitation to visit Ram’s birthplace and dubbing the consecration ceremony a “political event.” While the four Shankaracharyas—religious heads of Hindu monasteries in Dwarka, Gujarat; Jyotirmath, Uttarakhand; Puri, Odisha; and Shringeri, Karnataka—expressed concerns about holding the consecration ceremony when the temple construction is not yet complete, other religious leaders, like Shashikant Das and Mahant Narayan Giri, called the ceremony “an event of great fortune,” explaining that the sanctum sanctorum, or the garbhagriha(“womb room”), of the temple is ready. Opinions differed even within these political parties. In a gesture showing solidarity with the inauguration of the Ram Mandir, contrary to some party colleagues, Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Kamal Nath wrote the name of Lord Ram 108 times on blank papers after offering prayers at the Hanuman temple in Simariya, Maharashtra.</p>

        <p  class="ijk">The temple complex, spread over an area of 70 acres (28 hectares), is expected to be built in phases; the first phase was completed in time for the consecration ceremony. The main temple will have a total area of 57,400 square feet (5,330 square meters) and will have three floors and 12 gates. Experts in the hospitality sector expect the new temple to create thousands of jobs in Ayodhya and its neighboring towns. Pop. (2001) 49,417; (2011) 55,890.</p>

<h3>People’s reactions</h3>
<p><img class="efg" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d5/e1/6d/d5e16d7d65d32090971af21d67521092.jpg" height="350px" width="400px"></p>

<p class="ijk">While a large part of the country celebrated the inauguration of the long-awaited Ram Mandir with chants of Ram’s name, fireworks, saffron flags (the color saffron is associated with Hinduism by many, is used in the Indian national flag, and is the color of the flag used by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), and the lighting of diyas (lamps) in temples across the country, the event evoked more-measured reactions and criticism from some quarters. Senior Congress Party leaders, such as Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, turned down the invitation to the consecration ceremony. Some of them visited the temple before the inauguration day, saying they did not need an invitation to visit Ram’s birthplace and dubbing the consecration ceremony a “political event.” While the four Shankaracharyas—religious heads of Hindu monasteries founded by Shankara in Dwarka, Gujarat; Jyotirmath (earlier known as Joshimath), Uttarakhand; Puri, Odisha; and Shringeri, Karnataka—expressed concerns about holding the consecration ceremony when the temple construction is not yet complete, other religious leaders, such as Shashikant Das and Mahant Narayan Giri, called the ceremony “an event of great fortune,” explaining that the garbhagriha of the temple, the most important part, is ready. The Kerala chief minister and Communist Party of India leader Pinarayi Vijayan issued a statement expressing concern about the government’s involvement in a religious event and noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, believed in the separation of religion and state so that secularism could be preserved. After the consecration ceremony, some Indian cinema celebrities posted the preamble of the Indian constitution on social media as a reminder of the country’s secular roots. Opinions, however, differed even within political parties that are largely opposed to the central government’s involvement in a religious event. In a gesture showing solidarity with the inauguration of the Ram temple, contrary to some party colleagues, Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Kamal Nath wrote the name of Lord Ram 108 times on blank papers after offering prayers at the Hanuman temple in Simariya, Maharashtra.</p>

        The historical background of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir can be traced back to ancient times. Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, holds immense religious significance for Hindus. The city is mentioned in various Hindu scriptures and epics, including the Ramayana. According to Hindu mythology, Ayodhya was ruled by Lord Rama’s father, King Dasharatha of the Ikshvaku dynasty. Lord Rama, considered to be the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu, was born in Ayodhya and spent his early years in the city.<br><span style="padding-left: 40px;"></span> But Ayodhya's true essence lies not just in its historical tapestry, but in its deep connection to the epic Ramayana. This is the city where Lord Rama, the embodiment of righteousness and valor, was born. Every corner evokes a scene from the beloved saga: the coronation halls where Rama ascended the throne, the bustling squares where he walked with his brothers, and the serene banks of the Sarayu River where Sita, the embodiment of beauty and devotion, awaited. Ayodhya becomes a living canvas, painted with the vibrant colors of mythology, where every stone whispers Rama's name.<br>
     <span style="padding-left: 40px;"></span> As you walk through Ayodhya's ancient streets, the very air vibrates with the echoes of chants and chariot wheels. Temples like Kanak Bhavan, believed to be Rama's birthplace, and Ram Ki Paidi, where he is said to have taken his first steps, transport you back in time. Holy sites like Hanuman Garhi, dedicated to Rama's loyal monkey god, and Sita Ki Rasoi, where Sita is said to have cooked, resonate with the fervor of centuries of devotion. Ayodhya is not just a city; it's a pilgrimage, a tangible connection to the timeless tale of the Ramayana that continues to inspire millions.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 40px;"></span> 
           Walk to the grand Dashrath Mahal, the ruins of Rama's palace, and imagine the echoes of laughter and celebration during his coronation. Climb the 414 steps of Ram Ki Paidi, each step reminding you of the king's descent into exile. Touch the waters of the Sarayu, the same river that witnessed Rama's bittersweet farewell to Sita. Ayodhya becomes a physical map of Rama's journey, a living testament to his trials and triumphs. Every landmark breathes with the story, inviting you to walk in the footsteps of the hero and experience his saga firsthand.</p>

    <p class="my3">The Shri Ram Mandir finds its mythical roots in the Ramayana, an ancient Hindu epic attributed to the sage Valmiki. The Ramayana narrates the life and adventures of Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Rama was born in Ayodhya to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya.<br><span style="padding-left: 40px;"></span> 

        The epic begins with the divine birth of Rama and his three brothers, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna. The early years of Rama’s life are marked by his marriage to Sita, an incarnation of the goddess Lakshmi. However, Rama’s exile to the forest, prompted by the schemes of his stepmother Kaikeyi, sets in motion a series of events leading to the legendary battle against the demon king Ravana.<br><span style="padding-left: 40px;"></span> 
        
        The central episode of the Ramayana, known as the “Ramayana Yuddha” or the Battle of Lanka, culminates in Rama’s victory over Ravana and the rescue of Sita. After the triumphant return to Ayodhya, Rama is crowned as the king, marking the beginning of the ideal rule known as “Ram Rajya.” The narrative of the Ramayana encapsulates themes of duty, righteousness, and the victory of good over evil.</p>

            The main temple will have three floors, going up to a total height of 161 feet (49 meters). It will be 360 feet (110 meters) long and 235 feet (72 meters) wide. The temple will feature 5 congregation halls (mandapas) and 12 gates. Designed by architect Chandrakant Sompura and his son Ashish Sompura, the temple is built in the Nagara style of architecture, similar to the Sun Temple at Konark, Odisha. The Nagara style is characterized by its distinctive shikhara—that is, a superstructure, tower, or spire above the garbhagriha. The spire and the garbhagriha of the Ram temple have a unique octagonal shape, unlike the traditional square-shaped garbhagrihas. Although no iron or steel has been used to build the temple, it is expected to withstand natural calamities for the next 2,500 years because it has undergone 3D structural analysis, according to Ashish Sompura. Pink sandstone from Bansi Paharpur and marble from Makrana, both in the state of Rajasthan, have been used to construct the temple. Once completed, the temple complex will have lifts and ramps for people with mobility difficulties, a sewage treatment plant, a water treatment plant, and a power station. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust plans to keep a large green area constituting about 70 percent of the complex and to conserve environmental water.<br><br>

            <p class="a2">The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, set up by the Government of India, is responsible for the construction and management of the temple. The main temple is built over 2.7 acres (1.1 hectares), and the temple complex is spread over an area of 70 acres (28 hectares). Work on the temple and the surrounding complex is being completed in phases. The construction of the temple’s ground floor, with the garbhagriha (“womb room”) for the deity, was completed in time for the consecration ceremony in 2024, a year in which India is set to have its Lok Sabha elections.

            The site of the temple is the subject of communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in India, as it is the former location of the Babri Masjid mosque, which was built between 1528 and 1529. The idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992. In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for construction of a temple, while Muslims were given land nearby in Dhannipur to construct a mosque. The court referenced a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic.</p><br>

<p class="a2"><span style="padding-left: 40px;"></span>On 5 August 2020, the bhumi pujan (transl. ground breaking ceremony) for the commencement of the construction of Ram Mandir was performed by Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India.The temple complex, currently under construction, is being supervised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. On 22 January 2024, Modi served as the Mukhya Yajman (transl. chief patron) of rituals for the event and performed the prana pratishtha (transl. consecration) of the temple.The prana pratishtha ceremony was organised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.The temple has attracted a number of controversies due to alleged misuse of donation, sidelining of its major activists, and politicisation of the temple by the Bharatiya Janata Party.</p>
<p class="a2"><span style="padding-left: 40px;"></span>It was officially announced by Champat Rai, the General Secretary of the Sri Ram Janmbhoomi Kshetra Trust, that 22 January 2024 would be the scheduled date for the installation of the Ram Lalla idol in the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum). On 25 October 2023, a formal invitation was extended to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the ceremony.In 2020, the national spokesperson of the Nirmohi Akhara, Mahant Sitaram Das, criticised the BJP's decision to have the temple foundation begun by Narendra Modi and said that the work of building the temple should be done only by the religious priests. A number of Hindutva proponents, including online social media influencers, raised objections over the temple's construction with regards to its design and involvement of the Muslims, claiming that they found Islamic motifs in the Ram Mandir. Champat Rai, the general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust, responded to these concerns by saying that temple was being sculpted by experts, and there could be no question about their religion.[verification needed] The vice-president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Pandit Ashok Sharma, said that the BJP "got the entire thing politicised."</p>

      The Ramayana( Sanskrit: रामायणम्, romanized: Rāmāyaṇa) also known as Valmiki Ramayana, as traditionally attributed to Valmiki, is a smriti text (also described as an Sanskrit epic) from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism known as the Itihasas, the other being the Mahabharata. The epic narrates the life of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya in the kingdom of Kosala. The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across forests in the Indian subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana; the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana, the king of Lanka, that resulted in war; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya along with Sita to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration.

 <p class="history3">Ayodhya, located in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, is one of the oldest cities in India and holds immense religious significance in Hinduism. It is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama, a major deity in Hinduism, and the setting of the ancient epic Ramayana. Ayodhya has been a center of pilgrimage for Hindus for centuries. In recent history, Ayodhya gained prominence due to the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, a socio-political conflict over a religious site in the city. This conflict culminated in the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, leading to significant communal tensions and legal battles. The site is now slated for the construction of a Ram Temple following a Supreme Court verdict in 2019. Today, Ayodhya remains an important cultural and religious center in India.</p>

<p class="priya2">The Ayodhya dispute is a complex social, religious, historical, and political debate in India revolving around a land in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. The conflict dates back over 500 years and has seen various legal and historical developments, culminating in a landmark Supreme Court verdict on November 9, 2019.
      <br>
      The demolition of the mosque resulted in several months of inter-communal violence between India's Hindu and Muslim communities, causing the death of an estimated 2,000 people in Bombay (now Mumbai) as a direct consequence, and triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent. A day after the demolition of the mosque, on 7 December 1992, The New York Times reported that over 30 Hindu temples across Pakistan were attacked, some set on fire, and one was demolished. Hindu temples in Bangladesh were also attacked.

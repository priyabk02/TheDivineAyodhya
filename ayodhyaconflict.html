    <h1>CONFLICTS</h1>
    
        <p><img id="piya" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.3168bccdc22881cdf3c591c661b27fd4?rik=fXEWneOS8Fx3bg&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.indianetzone.com%2fphotos_gallery%2f106%2f2_First_Rohilla_War.jpg&ehk=DJTmwYwbv4p2PE8%2fvpQONnoKnUeAEAM5GLiiseZHvPc%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0"  height="260px"  width="360px"></p>
        <p class="sony"><span class="red">Rohilla War</span>, (1774), in the history of India, the conflict in which Warren Hastings, British governor-general of Bengal, helped the nawab of Oudh (Ayodhya) defeat the Rohillas by lending a brigade of the East India Company’s troops. This action later formed a preliminary charge in a parliamentary impeachment of Hastings, but Parliament vindicated him.</p>

           <p class="sony"> The Rohillas were Afghans who had entered India in the 18th century during the decline of the Mughal Empire and gained control of Rohilkhand (formerly Katehr). When threatened by the Marathas, they sought help from Ayodhya, but they failed afterward to pay stipulated sums. Hastings supported Ayodhya in crushing the Rohillas in order to strengthen Ayodhya as a buffer between the company and the Marathas. Hastings’s critics charged him with letting out troops on hire and condoning atrocities.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Ram Janmabhoomi–Babri Masjid Conflict</h2>
       
        <p class="sony">
        Despite the town’s great age, there are few surviving monuments of any antiquity. The numerous Vaishnava shrines and bathing ghats are of no great age. Close to the modern town are several mounds marking the site of ancient Ayodhya. These have not yet been adequately explored by archaeologists. The Babri Masjid (“Mosque of Bābur”) was built in the early 16th century by the Mughal emperor Bābur on a site traditionally identified as Rama’s birthplace and as the location of an ancient Hindu temple, the Ram Janmabhoomi. Because of its significance to both Hindus and Muslims, the site was often a matter of contention. In 1990, riots in northern India followed the storming of the mosque by Hindu nationalists intent on erecting a temple on the site; the ensuing crisis brought down the Indian government. Two years later, on December 6, 1992, the three-story mosque was demolished in a few hours by a crowd of Hindu nationalists. It was estimated that more than 2,000 people died in the rioting that swept through India following the mosque’s destruction. An investigative commission led by Manmohan Singh Liberhan, a retired judge, was formed in 1992 but did not issue a report until 2009. The report, when it finally appeared, caused an uproar because it blamed several leading figures from the pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party for the mosque’s destruction. A court ruling in 2010 divided the land between Hindus and Muslims, but that decision was overturned in 2019 by the Supreme Court, which entrusted the site exclusively to Hindus and directed the state to grant an alternate site in Ayodhya to the Sunni Waqf Board, which had claimed possession of the Babri Masjid.</p>
        
        <p><img id="kitta" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRPb8v6jjpdXfB39Tp-t-xVu9QqkO-95fZOArDI9P30jl5wdFHyKJ0alqZwBgCh15VTjyI&usqp=CAU" height="280px" width="500px"></p>

        <p class="sony">Conflict over the site has lasted for centuries. In 1856–57 Hindu-Muslim riots broke out at the disputed site, and the colonial government of India erected a wall, allotting the inner part to the Muslim community and the outer part to Hindus so they could retain structures significant to Hinduism, such as the Sita Rasoi (rasoi means “kitchen”) and the Ram Chabutara (chabutara means “platform”). The government’s decision to divide the site between Hindus and Muslims did not resolve the dispute; both sides continued to fight over it.</p>
        <p class="sony">Hindu-Muslim clashes in 1934 resulted in damage to the Babri Masjid’s dome, which was subsequently repaired. On December 22, 1949, the mosque was again desecrated by a group of people, and murtis of Ram were placed under the mosque’s central dome. Following this event, an attachment order was issued, and the chairman of the Municipal Board of Faizabad (Faizabad district was renamed to Ayodhya in 2018), Uttar Pradesh, was appointed as the receiver of the inner courtyard. Restrictions were placed on the general public, limiting entry beyond the wall.</p>
        <p><h2>Three Key Lawsuits Followed the Order:</h2>

            <p><img id="abc"src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.77lwBVymKWo7JOVaa6NMSgHaEJ&pid=Api&P=0&h=180" height="300px" width="400px"></p>
           <p ><ul class="sony">
            <li>In 1959 a Hindu body, the Nirmohi Akhara, filed a lawsuit and claimed the right of ownership and management for the site, arguing that this right was obstructed by the attachment order of 1949.</li>
            <li>In 1961 the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Board of Waqf (Sunni Waqf Board) and nine of Ayodhya’s Muslim residents filed a lawsuit claiming the title of the disputed land based on the contention that it was a mosque built on the instructions of the Mughal emperor Bābur and requested that the murtis placed at the site be removed.</li>
            
           <li> In 1989 senior advocate Deoki N. Agarwal filed a suit on behalf of the deity, claiming that the law recognizes both the murti and the birthplace as juridical entities. The suit claimed that the birthplace is a legal person that possesses a juridical status.</li>
           </ul></p>
         <p class="sony">At the crux of these lawsuits was the belief among Hindus that this site is Ram Janmabhoomi, the birthplace of Ram, and a temple dedicated to Ram existed at the spot before being destroyed during the Mughal conquest of India. On the other hand, Muslims argued that the Babri Masjid was built on vacant land, so Hindus do not have any proprietary claim over the site. On July 10, 1989, all key suits were transferred to the Allahabad High Court.Two years later, on December 6, 1992, a mob of Hindu activists destroyed the Babri Masjid.</p>
         
        
<p class="sony">Another significant development relating to the Ayodhya dispute about this time was the Rathyatra (“Chariot Tour”) led by BJP president Lal Krishna Advani from Somnath, Gujarat, to Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, in September–October 1990. This tour, spanning many Indian states, was in support of the demand by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP; “World Hindu Council”) for a Ram temple in Ram Janmabhoomi, which was the site where the Babri Masjid stood. Advani was arrested mid-tour and the Rathyatra came to an end, but massive protests and communal riots broke out, especially in northern India. A few days later a group of Hindu activists stormed the Babri Masjid, and some of them were killed in police action</p>

            <p class="sony">On September 30, 2010—after going through a large volume of evidence, including reports submitted by the Archeological Survey of India—the High Court ruled that the Nirmohi Akhara, the Sunni Waqf Board, and Lord Ram represented by Triloki Nath Pandey (a VHP activist who replaced Agarwal after his death in 2002) would be joint holders of the disputed premises, and each party was allotted one-third of the disputed property.</p>
            <p class="sony">The parties filed multiple appeals against the High Court judgment, and the Supreme Court of India stayed the High Court’s order in 2011. On January 8, 2019, Ranjan Gogoi, the chief justice of India at that time, constituted a five-judge bench to hear the appeals. Final arguments were heard beginning on August 6, and on November 9 the Supreme Court delivered its final judgment: it awarded the title to the deity and directed the central government to set up a trust to manage the construction of a Ram temple at the site. It added that the demolition of the Babri Masjid was against the rule of law and that the Sunni Waqf Board should be given an alternate site in Ayodhya to build a mosque.
